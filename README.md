# Saltarina
Saltarina is a simple tray-based app that allows your mouse to "hop" across gaps in your monitor arrangement to the next closest monitor.

Saltarina maps your monitor arrangement, and watches your mouse position. When your mouse "hits" the edge of a screen, it hops your mouse over to the next screen over. 

Saltarina may also be set up to AutoStart on login.
